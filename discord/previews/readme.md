# Installation Guide
To use a theme on Discord, you need to use a modified client (discord is lame and expects users to pay for client-side modifications, lmaoo). There is a bunch of popular not official discord clients available, the most well known and trusted are:
1. [vencord](https://vencord.dev/)
2. [betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)

In this guide, I'm only going to go over the installation process on vencord, but finding a tutorial for theme installing on betterdiscord shouldn't be hard (it's literally a couple of seconds). The first thing that you're going to have to do is obviously installing vencord. After doing that go to the settings > Themes > Online Themes; and then paste one of the wanted stylesheets that you can find in the [themes.txt](https://khenzii.dev/freebobux) to the input element :)
