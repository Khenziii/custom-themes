# Custom Themes
Just a repo containing all of the themes that i have created and am / was using =)

# Additional Info
## Installing A Theme
The installation process ofcourse varies on whatever app you're installing the theme for; and that's why I'll put a file called "readme.txt" inside of every app's directory. Don't be shy to take a look at it if you're encountering problems!
## Checking Themes Out
I will put previews of the themes inside of "previews" directory in the theme's folder üëç. I will also try to create "readme.md" files showing the images so that the themes are easier to checkout.
